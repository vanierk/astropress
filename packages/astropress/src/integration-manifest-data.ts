/**
 * Static catalogue of /ap-admin integrations and their honesty tier.
 *
 * Split from integration-manifest.ts so the pure-data manifest is not
 * mutation-tested: each entry is a top-level static mutant whose value
 * (href strings, navKey strings, status enum) only restates the typed
 * shape. Behavioural accessors (`integrationsByStatus`, `findIntegrationByHref`)
 * live in integration-manifest.ts and are mutation-tested there.
 *
 * `audit:integration-honesty` cross-checks this manifest against the
 * actual page files so the partition stays truthful as the codebase
 * evolves. The plugin sidebar and AdminLayout both read from
 * `INTEGRATIONS`; adding or moving an integration is a single edit here.
