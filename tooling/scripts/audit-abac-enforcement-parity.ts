/**
 * audit-abac-enforcement-parity.ts
 *
 * The ABAC class (#101/#104/#106/#110/#114/#121/#125/#135) is a string of
 * authorization gaps: admin action routes that ran with only session+CSRF (no
 * authorization), or gated on the coarse `requireAdmin` break-glass instead of
 * their declared fine-grained permission; and admin listing pages that rendered
 * data with no `requiresAccess` guard at all. This audit fails if either
 * recurs.
 *
 * Rules:
 *  1. Every action route under `pages/ap-admin/actions/**` must pass a
 *     `requireAction: "<perm>"` to its guard — except the reviewed pre-session
 *     flows (token consumption before a session exists), and except a route
 *     with a dynamic per-resource guard (see `hasDynamicPerResourceGuard`
 *     below). `requireAdmin` is no longer an acceptable substitute for the
 *     declared permission.
 *  2. Every `requireAction` value must be a real action in
 *     `src/access/action-registry-data.ts` (no typo'd / dangling permissions).
 *  3. The admin listing/hub pages that were previously unguarded must keep their
 *     `requiresAccess(...)` page guard (locks in #104/#106/#125/#135).
 *
 * Exit 0 — actions and the guarded pages are all in parity. Exit 1 — a gap
 * reappeared.

/**
 * A narrow, explicit fingerprint for the one other sanctioned bypass of rule
 * (1): a dynamic per-resource guard. A static `requireAction: "<literal>"`
 * can't be right when one action route restores/mutates several resource
 * types that each need a different permission (e.g. `restore.ts` — restoring
 * an author needs `authors:manage`, not whatever action a different table
 * would need) — `withAdminFormAction`'s own requireAction check runs before
 * formData is parsed, so it can't yet know which resource is involved. The
 * valid alternative is a manual check, evaluated after the resource is known,
 * using the exact same primitives `withAdminFormAction` itself uses
 * internally (see `admin-action-utils.ts`'s `enforceRequireAction`): resolve
 * the access context, call `.can(action)`, and on anything but allow, log the
 * deny and block. c953a5a introduced this pattern for `restore.ts`.
 *
 * Deliberately requires ALL THREE tokens, not just one — each alone is too
 * weak a signal:
 *   - `getAccessContext(` alone proves nothing (e.g. a page might call it
 *     just to read `access.subject.email` for display, with no gating).
 *   - `.can(` alone is too generic to grep reliably.
 *   - `logAccessDeny(` has no purpose except logging a genuine deny
 *     decision — its presence alongside the other two is what makes this a
 *     reliable signal of a real gate, not incidental access-context use.
 * A route that imports all three without actually wiring them into a
 * fail-closed check would be deliberately misleading, not an accidental
 * regression — outside what a static grep can be expected to catch, same as
 * rule (1)'s existing static-literal check doesn't verify the literal is
 * actually reachable/enforced either.
