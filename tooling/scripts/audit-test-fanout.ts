// Static audit that flags test files which read or import too many distinct
// source-path string literals. High fan-out test suites are a stryker
// incremental-cache hazard: editing the test file invalidates mutant verdicts
// across every src file the suite covers, so a 1-line change to a 20-fan-out
// suite re-runs mutation testing on 20 src files instead of 1.
//
// The metric is "distinct file-path string literals referenced from the test"
// (an OR of `path.join("…")`, `path.resolve("…")`, and bare ".astro"/".ts"/".css"
// string literals). It correlates with the set of source files vitest will
// actually load when the test executes, which is what stryker's incremental
// algorithm hashes for invalidation purposes.
//
// Threshold: 8 distinct paths. Tests above the threshold must either:
//   (a) be split into smaller files focused on a single concern, or
//   (b) be added to ALLOWLIST below with a one-line rationale.
//
// Why 8: empirical — most well-scoped suites in this repo touch ≤5 files;
// the 6–7 band is "tightly-related cluster", and ≥8 starts being where edits
// cause cache fan-out we'd notice on a long-running branch.
